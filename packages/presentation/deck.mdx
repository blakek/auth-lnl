# Authentication <And /> Authorization

<Appear>

> …but really a talk about <u>Basic Auth</u> and <u>OAuth2</u>

</Appear>

</Invert>

---

## What are we talking about today?

- Authentication vs. authorization
- Common ways we deal with these
- Examples

---

## Authentication <And /> Authorization

### Are they the same?

No

<Appear>

To be fair, they’re ususally used together.

</Appear>

<Notes>

This may sound like we're getting too detailed, but I think it helps to
understand what we'll talk about later.

</Notes>

---

<Notes>

This is really an over-complicated definition. I hope you'll understand what it
means in just a second, though.

</Notes>

## Authentication <And /> Authorization — Meaning

> **Authentication** is the act of confirming the truth of an attribute of a<br />
> single piece of data claimed true by an entity.

> **Authorization** is the function of specifying access rights/privileges to<br />
> resources related to information security and computer security in general<br />
> and to access control in particular.

## Authentication <And /> Authorization — Meaning

**Authentication**: proving you are who you say you are

**Authorization**: proving you have permission to do something

<Appear>
<aside>

(It’s arguable that the HTTP standard uses these [incorrectly](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/401))

</aside>
</Appear>

<Notes>

Don't worry too much about using these correctly all the tine.
You'll start to notice where they're used incorrectly by very smart people all
the time.

(Read first paragraph of linked MDN doc)

</Notes>

---

## Common Usages in Web Services

- Basic Auth (authentication, authorization is separate)
- SAML (authorization and authentication part of standard)
- OAuth 2.0 (authorization with common options for authentication)

**NOTE:** these are not mutually exclusive

<Notes>

We use OAuth 2.0 the most here.

We'll try and touch on all, but most of our time will be spend on OAuth 2.0.

…not mutually exclusive. A service can implement all 3 if needed.

# Let’s talk about Basic Auth

</Invert>

---

## Basic Auth — Why

Straightforward way of adding authentication to a service

---

## Basic Auth — How it Works

- Send a user’s credentials to server
- Uses HTTP headers
- Server uses own logic to check credentials (and optionally authorization)

---

## Basic Auth — Flow

- Prompt user for username/password directly
- Encode username/password for adding to header
- Add to `Authorization` header with HTTP requests

---

## Basic Auth — Implementing (Client-Side)

- combine username, colon (`:`), and password
- Base64 encode (this is **not** encryption)
- send in future requests as `Authorization: Basic {{encoded value}}`

---

</SyntaxHighlighter>

---

## Basic Auth — Implementing (Server-Side)

- Look at `Authorization` header contents
- Base64 decode contents after `Basic`
- split value on colon for username and password

---

## Basic Auth — Pros <And /> Cons

<ProConList
  cons={[
    'nothing about authorization in spec',
    'user credentials given to external service',
    'service needs to store credentials and user permissions',
    'user needs new credentials for service',
    'difficult for IT departments to control'
  ]}
  pros={['easy to implement']}
/>

## Basic Auth — Usage Suggestions

One-off app/service/website where minimizing<br />
up-front cost is a priority

# Let’s talk about SAML

</Invert>

---

## SAML

No examples. Just the basics.

<Notes>

For sake of time, we're going to basically skip SAML. However, it's good to know
why it's used.

</Notes>

---

## SAML

- notoriously complicated to set up
- terminology is confusing
- fairly easy for system admins once set up
- specs focuses on authentication and authorization
- spec is flexible
- “Enterprise” SSO
- **user account can be created immediately on all necessary services**
- **don’t need user’s password for a service**

<Notes>

- It's not really _that_ complicated. It's mostly the terminology.
- Terminology is very specific to SAML.
- Last 2 bullet points are probably the biggest reasons to use.

</Notes>

---

## SAML — Why

Allows using one set of credentials for multiple services

---

## SAML — Flow

(Note, this is a very basic explanation)

0. **Before:** service is set up with SSO provider
1. user goes to app/service
1. service redirects to SSO provider
1. user logs into SSO provider
1. SSO provider redirects to app/service
1. app/service keeps in contact with SSO provider for user permissions

---

## SAML — Pros <And /> Cons

<ProConList
  cons={[
    'requires SSO system to be set up',
    'difficult/expensive to start (for service and company)'
  ]}
  pros={[
    'absolute control for IT departments',
    'user credentials are same across all SSO systems',
    'user credentials are saved by internal systems only',
    'flexible spec'
  ]}
/>

---

## SAML — Usage Suggestions

- App/service/website that is focused on enterprise usage

---

<Invert>

# Let’s talk about OAuth 2.0

</Invert>

---

## OAuth 2.0

- flexible <And /> secure
- terminology can be confusing
- standard focuses on authorization only
- can “add on” authentication; OpenID Connect
- **don’t need user’s password for a service**

<Notes>

- Although standard focuses on authorization, most OAuth users also use it for
  authorization
- Popular services tend to differ on how authorization works
- OpenID Connect is an attempt to standardize authentication portion

</Notes>

---

## OAuth 2.0 — Why

Separate authorization from the service

<Notes>

That may not sound very important, but it's opened a lot of new possibilites:

</Notes>

---

## OAuth 2.0 — Why

10 years ago, people were apparently fine giving out their credentials:

![Screen capture of Facebook prompting for a Skype username and password](http://seniornet.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Find-Fb-Friends.jpg)

<Notes>

At least they have this:

> Facebook won't store your password

</Notes>

---

## OAuth 2.0 — Why

10 years ago, this thing was 1 year old:

  height="300"
  width="300"
/>

---

## OAuth 2.0 — Why

Integrating with other services, authenticating without a server, and<br />
authenticating mobile apps are all more secure thanks to OAuth 2.0.

---

<Notes>

When you look up information, you'll come across these terms.
This is mostly to familiarize you with the terminology.

- **Resource owner** - the "user"; owns the data being accessed
- **Client** - the service accessing the data; e.g. service we'd likely make
- **Authorization server** - accounts.google.com
- **Resource server** - Google APIs; can be separate or same as authorization server
- **Authorization grant** - "APP_NAME wants to access your contacts"
- **Scope** - things that are granted
- **Access token** - used as temporary, expiring credentials the client uses in
  requests to the resource server
- **Refresh token** - used to get a new access/refresh token

</Notes>

## OAuth 2.0 — Terminology

- Resource owner
- Client
- Authorization server
- Resource server
- Authorization grant
- Scope
- Access token
- Refresh token

---

## OAuth 2.0 — How it Works

- Authorization server responsible for authentication and authorization
- Often uses redirects so authorization server can prompt for credentials directly
- Client app is given a short-lived access token
- Uses HTTP headers to send access token to resouce server

---

## OAuth 2.0 — Flow

0. **Before:** Register client app with a provider
   ([GitHub](https://github.com/settings/apps/new))
1. User redirected from client app to the authorization server
1. Auth server prompts user for username/password
1. Auth server asks if user is okay needed access
1. Auth server redirects back to client app with access code
1. Use authorization code to get an access/refresh token
1. Use access token to make API calls
1. When access token expires, use refresh token for new access/refresh tokens

<Notes>

- This is a high-level summary of one type of flow
- Registering tends to be quite different from service-to-service

</Notes>

---

## OAuth 2.0 — Flow

There’s different grant types (aka flows) that serve different purposes:

- Authorization Code
- Authorization Code + PKCE
- Implicit
- Resource Owner Password
- Client Credentials

---

## OAuth 2.0 — Flow

- Website with server: _Authorization Code_
- Static website / Single-page app: _Authorization Code + PKCE_
- Native app: _Authorization Code + PKCE_
- Server-side script: _Client Credentials_

If you’re responsible for the client app **and** resource server, you can use
the (Resource Owner) Password grant
